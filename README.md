# 🎨 Pendulum Swinging Bucket Physics (Unity)

A **physics-based painting simulation** using **pendulum motion** in Unity.  
This project implements **realistic physics-based movement** for a bucket suspended as a pendulum, allowing it to create artistic patterns by dripping paint.

## 🏗️ Project Overview
- Simulates **pendulum movement** with physics equations.
- Paint drips based on the **bucket’s velocity and gravity**.
- Uses **minimal built-in Unity libraries** for objects and materials.
- Aims to create **procedural art** using physics.

## 🎮 Features
- **Physics-Based Simulation**: Implements Newtonian motion without relying on Unity’s built-in physics engine.
- **Custom Materials**: Uses manually created shaders or basic colors instead of built-in textures.
- **Minimal Dependencies**: Only necessary Unity components are used.
- **Real-Time Painting**: Paint is applied dynamically based on the pendulum’s motion.

## 🔧 Tech Stack
- **Engine**: Unity (C#)
- **Physics**: Custom kinematic calculations (Newton’s laws)
- **Rendering**: Procedural painting logic (custom shader/materials)
- **Input Handling**: Custom controllers for setting pendulum parameters
